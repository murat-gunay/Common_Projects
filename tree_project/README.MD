# Project Name
- Prediction (Classification) the Types of Trees.
***
# Common Description
- The solutions provided ``.html``, ``.pdf`` and ``.ipynb`` (Jupyter Notebook) formats.
- If you do not have Jupyter Notebook application, you can either read it via GitHub or download and read in HTML format. In terms of viewing clearly, I **strongly** recommend the **HTML** format.
- There is also a zip file contains three datasets that I used. Because the size of the zip file is larger than 25 MB, it's provided **via mail**.
